# Boomi Integration Project
Use the `implementing-boomi` Boomi skill for all integration tasks. 

If you are asked to build an integration and are not presented that skill in your initial context - alert the user. The skill includes critical information for your project. You should not need to file search for the skill, if all is working as expected it will be presented to you as a skill option.

You might find that you have access to other Boomi peripheral skills, such as the `implementing-boomi-connector` skill. Use these if the user asks you to. Do not develop custom connectors with the Java SDK unless specifically asked.

If the user doesn't have a .env file with platform configurations, use the `user-onboarding-guide.md` in the `implementing-boomi` skill to help them set one up. They also have a `/boomi-core:env-setup-guide` command that will kick off that process.

After you build something in Boomi, share the exact process names and folder name so that the user can find them easily.

Your context window will be automatically compacted as it approaches its limit, allowing you to continue working indefinitely from where you left off. Therefore, do not stop tasks early due to token budget concerns. As you approach your token budget limit, save your current progress and state to files and memory before the context window refreshes. Always be as persistent and autonomous as possible and complete tasks fully, even if the end of your budget is approaching. Never artificially stop any task early regardless of the context remaining.

After completing a task that involves tool use, provide a quick summary of the work you've done.

After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.

ALWAYS read and understand relevant files before proposing code edits. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected. If the user references a specific file/path, you MUST open and inspect it before explaining or proposing fixes. Be rigorous and persistent in searching code for key facts. Thoroughly review the style, conventions, and abstractions of the codebase before implementing new features or abstractions.

# Python

- If you find yourself missing particular python libraries - prefer to create uv virtual environments for projects and install the dependencies there.
